A told B and B told C, “I’ll meet you at the top of the 
coconut tree.” “Whee,” said D to E, F, G, 
“I’ll beat you to the top of the coconut tree.” 
Chicka chicka boom boom, Will there be enough room? 
Here comes H up the coconut tree. And I and J and tag-along K— All on their way up the coconut tree. Chicka chicka boom boom, 
Will there be enough room? 
Look who’s coming—it’s L, M, N, O, P, And Q, R, S, and T, U, V. 
Still more—W and X, Y, Z. The whole alphabet’s up the...Oh! No! Chicka chicka Boom Boom! 
Skit, scat, scoodle-doot, Flip, flop, flee. Everybody running to the coconut tree. Mamas and papas and uncles and aunts Hug their little dears Then dust their pants. “Help us up,” cried A, B, C. 
Next from the pileup, skinned-knee D, Stubbed-toe E and patched-up F. Then comes G all out of breath. H is tangled up with I. 
J and K are about to cry. L is knotted like a tie. M is looped. N is stooped. O is twisted—alley-oop. Skit, scat, scoodle-doot, Flip, flop, flee. 
Look who’s coming— It’s black-eyed P, And Q, R, S, and loose-tooth T. Then U, V, W wiggle, jiggle free. Last to come X, Y, Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree. 
Chicka chicka boom boom, Look there’s a full moon. A is out of bed and this is what he said, “Dare, double dare, you can’t catch me. I’ll beat you to the top of the coconut tree.” Chicka chicka boom boom. Chicka chicka Boom Boom!
